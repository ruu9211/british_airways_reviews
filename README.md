# ✈️ British Airways Reviews Dashboard

## 🎯 Why I Built This Dashboard

Earlier this year, I flew with **British Airways to Thailand** for vacation.  
While the journey itself was memorable, I noticed that the **cabin service and food quality weren’t the greatest**.  
This made me curious: was my experience unusual, or do other passengers feel the same way?  

To find out, I built a Tableau dashboard analyzing thousands of British Airways reviews.  
By comparing different service categories and overall ratings, I was able to see how my personal experience aligned with broader customer sentiment.
